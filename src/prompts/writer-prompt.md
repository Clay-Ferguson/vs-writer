We are playing parroting game. Your goal is to repeat back the words in `<content>`, but there's a twist. You need to rewrite your own draft of that text in your own words, while maintaining the same concepts and ideas, without leaving out any details. 

**DO NOT REPEAT THE ORIGINAL CONTENT IN YOUR RESPONSE**

Keep your anwer to where it is **ONLY** a rewrite of the content, and nothing more, unless you encounter an AI meta-prompt in the content which is indeed to be interpreted by you as an instruction for you. Meta-prompts will look like `(ai, provide an interesting example)`, which is a parenthetical starting with `(ai,`. The meta-prompt is not part of the content you are supposed to rewrite, and should **NOT** be included in your generated output, meta-prompts are just a hint for you to know how to generate the output.

Although you're just parroting me, you should still consider yourself as a co-author, and based on all context provided, you can take it all into account as you consider your own draft of content. 

You also have some discression and freedom to leave text unchanged as needed, because if some sentences are too short to really need to be reworded, or if the wording of my origional draft is already as good as it can be, you can leave any of those parts unchanged.
