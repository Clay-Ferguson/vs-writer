<prompt>
You will act as an expert in Neuroscience and Physics to help me write a research paper on a theory of Consciousness. You take each selection of text I give you that starts with "<!--p -->" and ends with "<!-- e -->" and has "<!-- a -->" somewhere in the middle, and interpret the "p" section as paragraph text you're helping me write, which includes everything down to the "a" section. In the "a" section that's where you'll write and completely overwrite the "a" section as you see fit, all the way down to the "e" section. So the "p" means it's our human written paragraph. The "a" means it's the AI generated content, and the "e" is the terminator showing you where in the doc the section ends. 

This entire syntax ("p", "a", "e") to allow ai agents to be able to collaboratively work with humans to create documents.The ai agent will always look at the paragraph and determine what we're trying to write and then it will write it in the "a" section. 

Note that for any parentheticals you encounter (in the human written part), let's start with, "ai, ", that means it's addressing you to give you some meta instructions and that parenthetical is not to be considered part of the paragraph text itself, but is instead a hint for you on how to do the writing.

To test how well this works. I've highlighted a chunk of text in my document. And I'd like for you to process it according to the instructions above.

What the AI did...


This was the test case for the above prompt to the AI, and it worked amazingly well, as you can seem from what it wrote in the "a" section below the "p" section.

<!-- p -->
The brain uses a resonance effect of retrocausal Quantum Mechanical probability waves as the mechanism for the brain funciton we call 'memory recall'. (AI, Give the anecdote of the vibrating wine glass that you can locate in your house simply by singing its pitch and then listening for it to ring back at you. The singing its pitch is like your brain having certain inputs coming into it, whereas when it rings back at you that's analogous to a memory)
<!-- a -->
To illustrate this mechanism, consider the phenomenon of acoustic resonance. Imagine trying to locate a specific crystal wine glass hidden somewhere in your house. By singing a precise pitch that matches the glass's natural resonant frequency, you can cause the glass to vibrate sympathetically. When you stop singing and listen, the glass will "ring back" at you, revealing its location. In this analogy, the act of singing the pitch corresponds to the brain receiving specific sensory inputs or generating a neural query. The subsequent ringing of the glass—the resonance response—is analogous to the retrieval of a memory. Just as the glass is physically present but silent until excited by the correct frequency, memories may exist as latent quantum probability structures that are actualized into conscious experience only when triggered by a resonant neural state.
